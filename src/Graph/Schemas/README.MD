# Schemas
Schemas define how the actions will be called and what will they return. This is one of the most troublesome segments due to the schema's strong typification. It's composed by __types__, __queries__ and __mutation__ definitions. Types are also composed by other types until one type is only composed by recognized scalar types such as Int, String and Boolean.
