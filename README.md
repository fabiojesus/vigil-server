# VIGIL

Welcome to vigil, your smart test vigilance system.
Vigil is a web server application created for the Internet Information Systems subject for the master's degree on Software Engineering.
In order to host this server online, we will be using heroku.

Vigil uses a MongoDB database set on collections that can be seen on [src/data/README.md]
